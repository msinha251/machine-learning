## Midterm Project - Spaceship Titanic

In this project we are predicting whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly. To help you make these predictions, you're given a set of personal records recovered from the ship's damaged computer system.

### Data

Data is available in the `data` folder. The `train.csv` file contains the training set, where each row is a passenger record. The `test.csv` file contains the test set, where each row is a passenger record without the `Survived` column. The `sample_submission.csv` file shows the submission format.
